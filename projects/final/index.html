    <h1>The Battle of the New York Aces</h1>

    

    <p>Over the last few years the classic debate between New York baseball fans arises when it comes to which of either the Yankees or the Mets have the most dominant pitcher in baseball. Jacob DeGrom (Mets) and Gerrit Cole (Yankees) are at the top of their game at the moment, which just so happens to take place across town in the same state. Now, that argument just got a little bit more spicy as ex-National and Dodger superstar Max Scherzer just recently joined the Mets. But the question still remains, who is the best pitcher in New York?</p>

    <h5>"The DeGrominator"</h5>

    <p>As most Mets fans call him "DeGoat", Jacob DeGrom has surely been living up to the name over the last 5 years. The man is a bonified stud, who throws up to an 102 MPH fastball and a 93 MPH slider. Unfortunately, this style of pitching might've been a major factor that caused his legendary season in 2021 to be cut short right before the All-Star game in Colorado, due to inflammation in his throwing arm (right).</p> 
      
      <p>Nevertheless, DeGrom was on a historical pace this past season that surely would've not only allowed him to win his 3rd CY Young Award in the last 4 years, but he was on a path to setting records across the board. For instance, through the first four months of play, Jacob DeGrom had 117 strikeouts, 27 hits allowed, and a posted a 0.60 earned run average (ERA). "He's the 1st pitcher with 110+ strikeouts & 30 or fewer hits allowed in any 12-game span since at least 1901," according to MLB Network reporter Sarah Langs. Even with all this, one of the most eye-opening statistics doesn't even have to do with pitching. In the National League (NL), pitchers have to hit as well, usually batting last in their teams' respective lineup. Well that's for normal pitchers, for Jacob DeGrom, you might want to bat him higher. In his 33 at-bats this year (before he got hurt), he hit with a batting average of .364 which was the highest of any other pitcher with at least 30 at-bats in the entire MLB, including AL-MVP Shohei Ohtani. So not only can he pitch with ease, but he's doing it on both sides of the ball.</p>

<h6>"Cole Train"</h6>

    <p>Now after hearing everything about Jacob DeGrom, you may be wondering how anyone could be even considered in the same breath as the best pitcher in not only New York, but baseball as a whole. Well, Gerrit Cole of the New York Yankees may have something to say about that. The 6'4 right-hander came over to the Yankees in 2020 on a 9-year contract, after what was a career year for the Houston Astros in 2019 that led to a World Series appearance. Cole posted a 3.23 ERA which among the lowest in baseball and even for his standards, this year for Cole was not as good his 2020 season. Nevertheless, he set impressive marks throughout the 2021 season that most certainly cannot go unnoticed. </p>
      
      <p>Similar to DeGrom, Cole was setting records of his own and what seemed as a regular Monday night versus the Texas Rangers on May 17, turned into an all-time great achievement. Cole struck out three batters in a row in the 1st inning to become the first pitcher in MLB history to strike out 59 batters without allowing a walk. He even stat padded his record by striking out 56 batters without a walk in his next five starts after that record-setting game. What is even more incredible about this record is that "Cole's previous walk was on April 12, missing on the 8th pitch of an at-bat to Toronto's Lourdes Gurriel Jr. If that walk didn't happen, this record would be 75, dating back to the final batter he faced opening day", according to Sports Illustrated reporter Max Goodman in a tweet. </p>


  <h4>"Mad Max"</h4>    

    <p>Mets fans, if you thought DeGrom was the best pitcher in baseball, you might've just acquired at least the second or third best in the entire game. After signing a 3-year, $130 million contract in November, Max Scherzer now becomes part of a one-two punch with DeGrom at the top of a Mets rotation that looks extremely exciting. Not only is the 38-year-old a sure hall of fame pitcher, but he has shown no point of regression. This past 2021 season could be considered his best season yet as he posted his career low in ERA at 2.46. If that wasn't enough, Scherzer was held the best ERA and record in baseball for all pitchers after being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the July 30 deadline. For that point on, he had a 7-0 record with a 1.98 ERA. It's not only these statistics that make "Mad Max" who he is, but he competitive nature and desire to win is unlike any other. Just ask Nationals fans after beating the Astros in the 2019 World Series. </p>

    <p>These pitchers are historically great and at the rate the game of baseball is going at the moment, all three of these pitchers will end up in the Hall of Fame or at the very least in the discussion. It's a great time to be a baseball fan and no matter what fan you are, what these pitchers put on display is pure greatness. </p>
